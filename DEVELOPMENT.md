## Limitations

-   Relies on the stability and availability of the `junglee/Amazon-crawler` and `junglee/amazon-reviews-scraper` actors.
-   The quality of the review analysis depends on the complexity of the agent and the available review data.
-   OpenAI API key is required and should be provided as an environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY`).
-   Amazon's website structure may change, potentially breaking the scrapers.
